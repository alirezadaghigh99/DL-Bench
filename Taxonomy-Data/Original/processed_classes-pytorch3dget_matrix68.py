    def get_matrix(self) -> torch.Tensor:
        """
        Returns a 4×4 matrix corresponding to each transform in the batch.

        If the transform was composed from others, the matrix for the composite
        transform will be returned.
        For example, if self.transforms contains transforms t1, t2, and t3, and
        given a set of points x, the following should be true:

        .. code-block:: python

            y1 = t1.compose(t2, t3).transform(x)
            y2 = t3.transform(t2.transform(t1.transform(x)))
            y1.get_matrix() == y2.get_matrix()

        Where necessary, those transforms are broadcast against each other.

        Returns:
            A (N, 4, 4) batch of transformation matrices representing
                the stored transforms. See the class documentation for the conventions.
